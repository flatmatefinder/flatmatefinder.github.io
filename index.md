## Overview

FlatmateFinder is a website that is meant to bring people together as roommates. It illustrates various technologies, including:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

The Website rolls out in multiple different phases, we will call these phases Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3.

## Deployment

The website [flatmatefinder.xyz](https://flatmatefinder.xyz/) is our website that links to our deployed web application running on Digital Ocean. It contains HTTPS communication to encrypt the information that flows between the server and the browser. In addition, the web application is hosted using a custom domain name that corresponds to our final project name.

## Github Organization
